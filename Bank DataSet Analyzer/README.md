📈 Banking Dataset EDA with Python
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a banking dataset using Python’s powerful data science libraries like numpy,pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

🔍 Main Objectives:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Clean data by removing duplicates and unnecessary columns
- Identify categorical and numerical variables
- Check for missing values and unique entries
- Group and analyze key relationships (e.g. average balance by age)
- Calculate correlation between features

📊 Visualizations Covered:
- Distribution plots for age and all numeric features
- Correlation heatmap for numerical variables
- KDE-enhanced histograms for deeper insight

This EDA lays the groundwork for deeper modeling, customer segmentation, or business insights. It’s perfect for understanding structure, spotting trends, and communicating data visually.
